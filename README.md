- 👋 Hi, I’m @jasonpersinger
- 👀 I’m interested in learning web development, text-based RPGs, and tying my brain into knots.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basic stuff first:  GIT, HTML, CSS, JAVASCCRIPT.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on team projects or personal projects.  I just want to gain access to situations where I can demonstrate skills required to move a project forward.
